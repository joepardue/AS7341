# AS7341
This repository contains files related to my project to design and develop a PAR light sensor using the Adafruit as7341board via I2C from a Raspberry Pi Pico W. It will contain the CircuitPython source code, the 3D printer files for the case design, and the documentation.

I am learning to use github so expect some weirdness.

I am using the AS7341 breakout board from Adafruit.com at: https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=as7341
I intend to build cases for this board using OpenSCAD and I will put those files here. 

The prototype case will consist of two parts, a lid and a base.
The lid will serve to cover the AS7341 port with a 3D print with clear PLA to provide a diffusion effect.

The base will be printed in black PLA to block light. I will test for light tightness and make changes as necessary.

This is an image of an early iteration of the case and lid. And, yes I see this is a crap print, but it is a prototype.

This is an image of an early iteration of the case with the lid in place, but not screwed down - along with a mm/cm rule for size.
