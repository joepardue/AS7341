# AS7341
This is circuitpython code to run the Adafruit as7341board via I2C from a Raspberry Pi Pico W
I am learning to use github so expect some weirdness.
I am using the AS7341 breakout board from Adafruit.com at: https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=as7341
I intend to build cases for this board using OpenSCAD and I will put those files here. 
One case will serve to cover the AS7341 port with a 3D printed screw on lid printed with clear PLA to provide a diffusion effect.
The basic case will be printed in black PLA to block light. I will test for light tightness and make changes as necessary.
Another case will have a port allowing the AS7341 open access and allow the included LED to shine so that this case can be used to measure colors.

This is an image of an early iteration of the case and lid. And, yes I see this is a crap print, but it is a prototype.

This is an image of an early iteration of the case with the lid in place, but not screwed down - along with a mm/cm rule for size.
